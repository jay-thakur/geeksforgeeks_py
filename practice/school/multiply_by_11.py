Today Kevinâ€™s Teacher taught Kevin, Multiplication table of 11.After reaching home, Kevin thought of multiplying the numbers with 11 and
finding the answers.Help Kevin finding the answers as soon as possible.

Input: First line of input contains T number i.e number of test cases, each test case followed by T numbers.

output: For each test case, Print a single integer.

Constraints:
0<=T<=100
0< Number of Digits in Integer <=1000000

Input:
3
8
12
15

Output:
88
132
165
Explaination:
