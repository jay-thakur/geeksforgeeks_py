"""
Given three positive integers X, Y and P. Here P denotes the number of turns. Whenever the turn is odd X is multiplied by 2 and in every even turn Y is multiplied by 2. The task is to find the value of max(X, Y) รท min(X, Y) after the complete P turns.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows, a single line of the input containing three integers X,Y and P.

Output:

For each test case, print the value of max(X, Y) รท min(X, Y) after the complete P turns .
Constraints:

1<=T<=100

1<=X<=Y<=P<=1000
Example:

Input:
2
1 2 1
3 7 2

Output:
1
2
