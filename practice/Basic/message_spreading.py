They want to share the funny stories with each other by sending electronic messages.

What is the minimum number of messages they need to send to guarantee that everyone of them gets all the funny stories?

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each testcase contains an integer N denoting the number of students.

Output:
For each testcase, print the minimum number of messages they need to send to guarantee that everyone of them gets all the funny stories.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100000
