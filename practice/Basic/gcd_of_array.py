"""
Given an array of N positive integers. Your task is to find the GCD of all numbers of the array.

Input:
First line of input contains number of test cases T. First line of test case contains a positive integer N, size of the array. Next line contains the array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, print the GCD of array elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= Arr[i] <= 106

Example:
Input:
1
2
5 10

Output:
5
