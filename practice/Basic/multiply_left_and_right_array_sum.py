Pitsy needs help in the given task by her teacher. The task is to divide a array into two sub array (left and right) containing n/2 elements each and do the sum of the subarrays and then multiply both the subarrays.

Input:
First line consists of T test cases. Only line of every test case consists of an integer N.â€‹

Output:
Print the answer by dividing array into left and right array and add their elements individually and then multiply both the array

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=1000
1<=Ai<=100

Example:
Input:
2
4
1 2 3 4
3
4 5 6
Output:
21
44
